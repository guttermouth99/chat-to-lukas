I've spent the last three years building AI-powered systems that classify, rank, and surface information at scale. At baito, I architected LLM pipelines that have processed over 10 billion tokens—turning unstructured job data into structured, searchable knowledge. When I saw Perplexity's mission to build AI-powered search, I immediately recognized the same challenge I've been obsessing over: how to make information accessible, accurate, and instant.

As Co-Founder of baito, I've built the entire platform end-to-end: from designing the API architecture and implementing semantic search with vector databases, to shipping frontend features with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. I've integrated agent-based workflows that autonomously evaluate and classify data, and I've learned firsthand what it takes to make LLMs reliable in production—structured outputs, robust evaluation frameworks, and constant iteration.

What excites me most about Perplexity is the pace. I thrive in environments where shipping fast and learning from real users drives the product forward. At baito, I operated with full ownership: writing specs, designing interfaces, building backends, and deploying infrastructure. I didn't wait for tickets—I identified problems and solved them. This founder mindset, combined with deep technical expertise in the modern TypeScript/React/Node.js stack, is what I'd bring to your team.

I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to work at the intersection of Search, AI, and Product. I've built systems that integrate LLMs with existing pipelines, and I understand both the potential and the limitations of current models. I want to help push the boundaries of what AI-powered search can do.

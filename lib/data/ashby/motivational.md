I still remember my first web scraper. Its target was a simple career page. What started as a hobby project eventually grew into "baito", one of Germany's largest impact job boards. Your mission to build the highest standard of tooling for talent acquisition resonated with me immediately—because I have spent the last few years building exactly that, just on a smaller scale.

In the meantime, I have replaced manual scripts with fully automated, LLM-based pipelines. As Co-Founder of baito, I architected a system that autonomously classifies thousands of jobs every day. I rely on a modern stack of TypeScript, Next.js, Node, BullMQ, AI SDK, MongoDB, and vector databases. My work involved much more than just API integrations. I designed scalable data architectures, optimized embedding models for semantic search, and implemented resilient agent workflows that deliver precise results even at high volumes. I love evaluating the latest technologies and applying them in practice to solve real problems.

After my time as a Co-Founder, I am now looking for a new challenge where I can apply my product engineering mindset in a high-growth environment. Ashby’s culture of ownership and "solving problems, not tickets" is exactly what I am looking for. I can translate vague ideas into functioning applications and scale them. I work autonomously and pragmatically, always with the goal of making complex technology understandable and usable.

I am driven by the desire to build software that gives users leverage—tools that make them better at what they do. I want to build the recruiting tools I wish I had when I was scaling my own team. It would be a pleasure to work with you on the future of hiring.

You can get an impression of my way of working at [hirelukas.dev/ashby](https://hirelukas.dev/ashby). There you will find this application as an interactive experience. I look forward to a personal conversation.

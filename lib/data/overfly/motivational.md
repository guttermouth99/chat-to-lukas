I saw your job opening and it immediately resonated with me. Not just because our tech stacks are nearly identical with TypeScript, Next.js and AI but because we share the same DNA as builders. I have been building digital products since I was 17. From early side projects to platforms like jobscouts.io and talentalert.io, I have spent my career shipping code. I know the difference between building a cool demo and running a real business with actual users and revenue.

As the Co-Founder of **getbaito.com**, I experienced the full entrepreneurial rollercoaster. I owned the entire lifecycle from the first line of code to scaling a profitable business. What started as a simple regex scraper evolved into one of Germany’s largest impact job boards powered by a sophisticated LLM pipeline that processes over 7 million events monthly. This journey taught me that technology is only as good as the problem it solves. I learned to balance perfect code with shipping fast and validating hypotheses with real users.

Technically I am right at home in your stack. I architected our entire system using Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js. My work in migrating our legacy systems to modern AI workflows with Vector Databases and OpenAI was even recognized with an OpenAI award. I love the challenge of taking cutting-edge tech and turning it into reliable production features.

What excites me most about Overfly is your focus on being practical builders. I believe AI is the ultimate force multiplier for this kind of work. It allows us to move from idea to high-fidelity prototype in hours. However, I also know that AI requires robust Human-in-the-Loop systems to be truly effective in enterprise contexts. I want to bring this pragmatic product mindset to your team and help you build custom AI solutions that deliver real value to your clients.

I would love to swing by for a coffee and chat about how we can build cool things together.

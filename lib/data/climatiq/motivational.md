For the past three years, I have been building baito, one of Germany's largest job platforms focused exclusively on sustainable and social employment. Every day, I work on tools that help people find jobs at organizations making a positive impact. When I discovered Climatiq, I recognized the same mission applied to an even more fundamental problem: giving businesses the intelligence they need to reduce their carbon footprint. This is exactly the kind of challenge I want to work on.

At baito, I built the entire platform from the ground up using TypeScript, Next.js, React, and Prisma with PostgreSQL and MongoDB. The system processes over 7 million user events monthly and aggregates data from thousands of career pages. I designed the frontend architecture with a focus on performance and usability, building component-based UIs that help users navigate complex data. I integrated RESTful APIs, implemented state management patterns, and shipped features end-to-end with full ownership from product specification to production deployment.

What I find compelling about Climatiq is the combination of technical depth and meaningful impact. Building data-intensive tools that empower sustainability teams to work faster is precisely the kind of work I have been doing in a different domain. I understand what it takes to make complex data accessible through intuitive interfaces. I also bring experience working autonomously in a distributed team, which I understand is central to how Climatiq operates.

I am based in Berlin and have worked remotely with teams across Europe for years. My founder background has shaped how I approach problems: I take ownership, communicate clearly, and focus on outcomes rather than process. I am eager to apply my experience building sustainability-focused products to the challenge of embedding carbon intelligence into business decisions.

You can explore my work and this application interactively at hirelukas.dev/climatiq. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.
